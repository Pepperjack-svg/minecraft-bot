# Minecraft Bot with Chat Commands

This Python script allows you to create a Minecraft bot using the mineflayer library and control it based on chat commands. The bot can respond to specific chat messages and perform actions in the Minecraft world.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for mineflayer)
- The required Python and JavaScript dependencies mentioned in the script.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the script.

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

#pip install configparser
Install the required JavaScript dependencies using npm:

npm install mineflayer


4. Create a configuration file named `config.ini` in the same directory as the script. Customize it with your Minecraft server details and bot settings. Use `config.ini.example` as a template.

5. Run the script:
   python main.py

   
## Configuration

The bot's behavior can be configured using the `config.ini` file. Here's an example configuration:

```ini
[server]
host = your_minecraft_server.com
port = 25565

[bot]
name = YourBotName

[command]
position = !position
start = !start
stop = !stop
