# Minecraft Bot with Chat Commands

This Python script allows you to create a Minecraft bot using the mineflayer library and control it based on chat commands. The bot can respond to specific chat messages and perform actions in the Minecraft world.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for mineflayer)
- The required Python and JavaScript dependencies mentioned in the script.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the script.

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

#pip install configparser
Install the required JavaScript dependencies using npm:

npm install mineflayer


4. Create a configuration file named `config.ini` in the same directory as the script. Customize it with your Minecraft server details and bot settings. Use `config.ini.example` as a template.

## Configuration

## Configuration

The bot's behavior can be configured using the `config.ini` file. Here's an example configuration:

[server]
- host = your_minecraft_server.com
- port = 25565

[bot]
name = YourBotName

[command]
- position = !position
- start = !start
- stop = !stop


## Run the script:
   python main.py

## Stopping the Bot
To gracefully stop the bot, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the script is running. The bot will clear its actions and disconnect from the server.   


   
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors, please check the following:

Ensure that you have installed all the required dependencies.
Verify that your config.ini file is correctly configured.
Check for any console output or error messages for clues on what went wrong.
