# Minecraft Bot with Python and Mineflayer

This repository contains a Python script for creating and controlling a Minecraft bot using the Mineflayer library. The bot can be programmed to perform various actions in the Minecraft world based on received chat commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the bot, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for the `mineflayer` library)
- Minecraft Java Edition (to connect the bot to a server)
- [config.ini](#configuration) file with the necessary configuration details.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pepperjack-svg/minecraft-bot.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y nodejs
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Install the Mineflayer library for Node.js.

```bash
npm install mineflayer
```

## Configuration

Before running the bot, you need to configure it by editing the `config.ini` file. Here's what the configuration file should contain:

```ini
[server]
host = <Minecraft_Server_IP>
port = <Server_Port>

[bot]
name = <Bot_Username>

[command]
position = !position
start = !start
stop = !stop
```

- Replace `<Minecraft_Server_IP>` with the IP address of the Minecraft server you want the bot to connect to.
- Replace `<Server_Port>` with the port number of the Minecraft server (usually 25565).
- Replace `<Bot_Username>` with the desired username for your bot.
- Customize the chat commands under the `[command]` section as needed.

## Usage

To start the bot, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will connect to the specified Minecraft server and listen for chat commands. It can perform actions like displaying its current position or moving forward and jumping when instructed.

To stop the bot, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it's running.
